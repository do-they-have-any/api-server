# Do they have any…?

The worldwide spread of COVID-19 means that we are all called upon to take action to slow the spread of the disease and protect those around us. To protect ourselves and our neighbors, we are asked to wash our hands thoroughly and frequently, to avoid unnecessary gatherings, and to main physical distance between one another when out and about. Nonessential businesses have closed in many parts of the world, and those that remain open are increasingly putting more and more "social distancing" measures in place.

In particular, grocery stores in many places are limiting the number of people that may be in the store at a time. Increased numbers of people staying at home means that more people are cooking and eating at home, increasing the demand for groceries. Taken together, that means that grocery shoppers have to wait in line before getting into a store, and may then find out that the store doesn't have an essential item they need. In addition to being frustrating, that means shoppers may need to go to multiple stores to get everything they need, increasing contact with other people and increasing the change of spreading illness.

The "do they have any…?" project has two main goals:

1. Reduce unnecessary travel and interpersonal contact to slow the spread of COVID-19.
2. Improve the quality of life for ordinary people during this difficult time.

To do that, we're building a service where shoppers can check and report whether essential items are in stock at their local grocery store.
